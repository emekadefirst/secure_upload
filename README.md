Here’s a `README.md` for your secure file upload project using MinIO and file signature validation:

---

## 📁 Secure File Upload System with Signature Validation

This project provides a secure way to upload files to a MinIO-compatible object storage bucket. It validates each uploaded file using its **magic number (file signature)** to ensure its content matches the declared file extension — preventing spoofed or malicious uploads.

---

### 🚀 Features

* ✅ **File signature detection (magic number)**
* ✅ **Extension vs. content validation**
* ✅ **Secure uploads to MinIO/S3**
* ✅ **Error handling for invalid files**
* ✅ **Extensible file type support**

---

### 📦 Project Structure

```bash
.
├── cleaner.py          # Signature-based file validation logic
├── filemanager.py      # Upload logic with MinIO support
├── main.py             # Main secure_upload entry point
├── env.py              # Environment variables for MinIO credentials (not included)
```

---

### 🔐 Signature Validation

Before uploading, the file is inspected by reading its first bytes and comparing against known file signatures:

Supported types:

* JPEG (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`)
* PNG (`.png`)
* GIF (`.gif`)
* BMP (`.bmp`)
* TIFF (`.tif`, `.tiff`)
* PDF (`.pdf`)
* ZIP (`.zip`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`)
* RAR (`.rar`)
* MP3 (`.mp3`)
* MP4 (`.mp4`)
* GZIP (`.gz`)
* Executables (`.exe`, `.elf`)
* OGG (`.ogg`)

Mismatch or unknown file types are **rejected** before upload.

### 📂 How Upload Works

#### 1. Call `secure_upload(file)` from `main.py`

```python
from main import secure_upload

response = secure_upload(file)  # file is an UploadFile or similar object
```

#### 2. File is validated:

* If the extension does not match the actual file content → ❌ upload is aborted.
* If the file is invalid or unsupported → ❌ upload is aborted.

#### 3. Valid files are uploaded to MinIO via `MediaService.upload()`.

### 🛠 Environment Variables (in `env.py`)

Make sure to define the following variables:

```python
S3_ACCESS_KEY = "your-access-key"
S3_SECRET_KEY = "your-secret-key"
S3_ENDPOINT = "https://your-minio-endpoint"
S3_BUCKET = "your-bucket-name"
```

---

### 📤 Upload URL Format

Uploaded files are publicly accessible using the pattern:

```
https://{bucket}.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/public/{filename}
```

---

### ⚠️ Notes

* `MediaService.ensure_bucket()` will create the bucket on the first upload if it doesn't exist.
* All uploads are stored under the `public/` prefix.
* This works with both **MinIO** and **AWS S3-compatible APIs**.

### 📌 Requirements

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install minio urllib3
```
